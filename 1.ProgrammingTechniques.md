## Contents
* Key types (Option, Result)
* Control flow
* Better Control flow
* Error handling
* Ownership as design
* Traits

## Result

```rs
fn h(i: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
	match i {
		i if i >= 0 => Ok(i+10),
		_ => Err(format!("Input less than 0, found: {}",i))
	}
}

fn main() {
	let input: i32 = ...;
	match h(input) {
		Ok(result) => println!("Result: {}", result),
		Err(e) => println!("Err: {}", e},
	}
}
```

* Central to Rust error handling
* consider `Result<T, E>` equivalent to `T throws E`

## If Let
* syntactic sugar for non-exhaustive pattern matching
* if success do something, else do nothing

``` 
match h() {
	Some(i) => something
	_ => ()
}
```
becomes
```
if let Some(i) = h() { do something with i }
```

## methods on option and result to avoid using matchs and other control flows
### ?
* sugar for result (or option)
```
match h() {
	OK(i) => something
	err => return err
}
```
becomes
```
let x = h()?
```

* lets you be very concise

```
let x = h()?.foo()?.bar;
```

### map
* a common 'unpack, do something, repack and return' operation
```
fn add_four(x: i32) -> i32 { x+4 }

fn maybe_add_four(y: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
	match y {
		Some(i) => Some(add_four(i)),
		None => None,
	}
}
```

```
fn maybe_add_four(y: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
	y.map(|x| x+4)
}
```

* if there's something there (a Some variant) we apply the function that is passed, and wraps it in a Some, and if there's none we pass back None
* a map doesn't need to return an option with the same internal type as was passed in. You can call map on an `Option<i32>` and have it return a `Option<String>`

* the sig of map is

```rust
fn map<U, F>(self, f: F) -> Option<U>
	where F: FnOnce<T> -> U
```

### ands and ors
* a way to think of an option or result is as a sort of boolean: Some is the true cases, none is the false case.
* that means you can string them together with ands or ors. so if two options both return Somes, you has `a.and(b)`

```rust
// called on an Option<T>
fn and<U>(self, opt: Option<U>) -> Option<U>
fn or(self, opt: Option<T>) -> Option<T>
```
* `a.and(b)` the returns `b` if both the a and b are Some variants, otherwise it returns None
* `a.or(b)` returns None if both are None, if only one is a Some it returns that, and if both are Some it returns a
* these are eager versions of and or. You can have lazy versions

```rust
fn and_then<U, F>(self, f: F) -> Option<U>
	where F: FnOnce(T) -> Option<U>

fn or_else<F>(self, f: F) -> Option<T>
	where F: FnOnce(T) -> Option<T>

fn sq = |x| Some(x*x);
fn nope = |x: i32| -> Option<i32> {None};

Some(2).and_then(sq).and_then(sq) //evals to Some(16)
Some(2).and_then(sq).and_then(nope) //evals to None
Some(2).and_then(nope).and_then(sq) //evals to None
None.and_then(sq).and_then(sq) //evals to None
```

* `and_then`
	* checks the option it's being called on, if it's not a None it calls the function
	* if that function returns a Some then that's the result of the whole exression

* `or_else` checkt the option it's being called on, and if it's a Some the function never executes.

* you can think of `and_then` as like the map, but instead of always succeeding it can return a None
* the map method takes your function return (say an integer) and wraps it with a Some option varient, but the function you give to an and_then has to specifically return an option, so you can make it be a Some or a None as you like.

* you can think of or, or or_else, as having a default value. If option a has a value, then great, keep using it, but if it's None, then do this thing (use the second option or execute the function in each case)

## Convert between options and results and iters
```rust
impl Option<T> {
	fn ok_or<E>(self, err:E) -> Result<T,E>

	fn iter(&self) -> Iter<T>
}
```
* you can think of an option as a collection with 1 or zero elements. You might want to iterate over the collections

## filter
```rust
fn filter<P>(self, predicate: P) -> Option<T>:
	where P: FnOnce(&T) -> bool

opt.filter(|i| i >= &0) // returns Some(i) if i is >= 0, otherwise None
```
