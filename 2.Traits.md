# Traits

## Trait objects / Dynamic polymorphism
### what trait objects are for
* Trait objects allow you to store objects without specificying their type, instead specifying what traits they must implement
* for example you might want to define a `gui` struct which tracks a bunch of different type of objects (textboxes, buttons etc.), who only have in common that they implement the `Draw` trait (with a `draw` method).
* a trait object specifies a pointer to an object (with `&` or `Box<T>`) and using the `dyn` keyword, then specifies the trait. You can store this trait object in a Vec.
* Trait objects are more like traditional OO objects. They have data and behaviour, rather than keeping them separate.
* The difference is you can't _change_ the data in a trait object, that's not what they're for: they are just to allow abstractions across common behaviour.
* the concept, being concerned only with the method calls an object responds to, not its concrete type, is similar to duck typing.

### code example

```rust
pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}

impl Screen {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```

### trait objects vs. trait bounds
* notice that at no point do we specify trait bounds. Trait bounds can only be used for one concrete implementation at a time, but trait objects can have multiple types of trait objects at runtime. So the following code would restrict us to using structs of ONLY type `Button` or `TextField`.
* if you know you don't need that flexibility (i.e. you can get away with static polymorphism), trait bounds are better because the compiler will monomorphise everything to concrete types at compile time, which is much faster.

```rust
pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
    pub components: Vec<T>,
}

impl <T> Screen<T> where T: Draw {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for compoennt in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```

### under the hood: trait objects perform dynamic dispatch
* monomorphising (taking generic code and at compile time figuring out what types it applies to and generating concrete implementations) is also known as static dispatch.
* with trait objects, the compiler can't know at compile time what concrete types will be used at runtime, because they'll be specified by the client. In this case Rust must use dynamic dispatch.
* There is a runtime cost to this, because you are in effect denying Rust the opportunity to use compiletime optimisations

### object safety in trait objects
* only object-safe traits can be made into trait objects
* to be object safe if the following apply to all its methods:
    * the return type can't be `self`
    * there are no generic type parameters
